            Hello there! I'm Sarang Banakhede, a BTech student in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at MITS Gwalior. I'm on a journey to understand the fascinating world of data and its applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            My studies cover a range of interesting topics like computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning. I enjoy tackling challenges in these areas, always eager to learn and improve.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not buried in coursework, you might find me tinkering with datasets or trying to explain what AI actually means to my curious family members (it's not about robots taking over, I promise!).
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm also working on building a solid foundation in linear algebra, statistics, probability, and calculus – because let's face it, numbers are the real MVPs in data science.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I'm still learning and growing, I'm excited about the potential of data-driven solutions and hope to contribute meaningfully to the field someday.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just a friendly warning: I might get a bit excited when talking about algorithms – it's not every day you meet someone who finds joy in a well-optimized function!
        </p>
