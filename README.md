    <main>
        <p>Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed algorithms, and curious neural networks, allow me to introduce the one, the only, Sarang Banakhede!</p>
        
        <p>This walking, talking tensor of talent is currently pursuing a BTech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at MITS Gwalior. Don't let the "student" label fool you – Sarang's brain is a veritable supercomputer, processing life's challenges faster than you can say "gradient descent."</p>
        
        <p>Armed with an arsenal of skills that would make even the most sophisticated AI blush, Sarang navigates the realms of computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning with the grace of a self-driving car on an empty highway. Need someone to process an image? Sarang's your pixel-perfect person. Got a dataset that needs taming? Watch as Sarang wrangles those wild variables into submission.</p>
        
        <div>
            <p><strong>But wait, there's more!</strong> This mathematical maestro is fluent in the languages of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Linear Algebra</li>
                <li>Statistics</li>
                <li>Probability</li>
                <li>Calculus</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Sarang doesn't just crunch numbers; they make those numbers dance in n-dimensional space!</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>When not busy training neural networks or plotting world domination (on beautifully rendered scatter plots, of course), you might find Sarang on LinkedIn, connecting with fellow data enthusiasts and occasionally trying to explain machine learning concepts to confused relatives.</p>
        
        <p>So, whether you're looking for a dedicated data scientist, a passionate problem-solver, or someone to calculate the exact probability of winning the office lottery pool, look no further than Sarang Banakhede – where artificial intelligence meets natural brilliance!</p>
        
        <p><em>(Caution: Prolonged exposure to Sarang's enthusiasm for data science may result in spontaneous feature engineering and an irresistible urge to optimize everything in sight.)</em></p>
